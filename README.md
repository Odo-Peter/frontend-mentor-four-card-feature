## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As with previous challenges, this challenge has taught me the importance of a proper markup and the power of CSS, alongside media queries, also, in the cause of the challenge, learning to work with an API as usual again, feels awesome (by API, I meant importing the google fonts from google api and using it in the challenge).

The challenge has also improved my knowledge, in terms of using markdown files and in initializing a file to github, basically working with the command line has improved some more, all thanks to this and other frontend mentor's challenge.

### Useful resources

Ensure to be kind enough to give a little donation to help them to continue giving out value.
